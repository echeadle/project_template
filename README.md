# Claude Code Project Template

A starter template for building applications with Claude Code. Copy this folder to begin a new project with pre-configured commands, skills, and workflow structure.

This template was created using Claude Code and was inspired by a YouTube Video by Cole Medin: My COMPLETE Agentic Coding Workflow to Build Anything (No Fluff or Overengineering)
